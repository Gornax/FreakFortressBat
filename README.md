## A mixture of various popular plugins for FF2 and extra setting to give the best out of bosses and community servers!

### Installiton and Setup:
The download does not include boss configs, models, or subplugins. It is recommended that you install the [offical Freak Fortress 1.10.14](https://github.com/50DKP/FF2-Official/releases/tag/1.10.14 "Release FF2 1.10.14 · 50DKP/FF2-Official") bosses and subpugins before installing this edit. **To install this edit, download 'Source code' in releases** This edit generates some new cvars, so save a backup of cfg/sourcemod/FreakFortress2.cfg and delete it, it will generate new cvars. **Notes:**                                             
**All non-boss config (eg. characters.cfg, doors.cfg, and maps.cfg) need to go in data/freak_fortress_2/**                         
**This has it's own boss selection and toggle menu, if you wish to disable, see cfg/sourcemod/FreakFortress2.cfg**                 
**Always make sure to restart your server when applying updates or installing**
