### Installiton and Setup:
The download does not include boss configs, models, or subplugins. It is recommended that you install the offical Freak Fortress

this edit, download 'Source code' in releases. This edit generates some new cvars, so save a backup of
cfg/sourcemod/FreakFortress2.cfg and delete it, it will generate new cvars. Notes:

-= All non-boss config (eg. characters.cfg, doors.cfg, and maps.cfg) need to go in addons/sourcemod/data/freak_fortress_2/ =-
-=   This has it's own boss selection and toggle menu, if you wish to disable these see cfg/sourcemod/FreakFortress2.cfg   =-
